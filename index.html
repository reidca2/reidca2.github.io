							<h2>Blog Posts</h2>
							<p> Below are some blog posts that I have created over the years. The <a href="https://medium.com/@reidca2/why-every-student-should-watch-curb-your-enthusiasm-4e9d4091feaa"> first </a> is about why students should watch my favorite tv show, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and what they can learn from it. The <a href="https://medium.com/@reidca2/dont-know-what-you-re-doing-nobody-else-does-either-8e0e9904f532"> second </a> is about struggling to find your place in this world, and has become much more timely with the constraints Covid-19 has placed on peoples' future plans.

							<h2>Podcast</h2>
							<p>I'm pretty new to the podcasting game, but the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-892170295-3005879/lyrebirds-podcast"> lyrebirds </a> podcast came out fantastic. We talked about the effects of Covid-19 on the gaming industry, and I announced my undying love of call of duty. Check it out. </p>

							<h2>Video</h2>
							<p> Things have been pretty isolating for everyone during quarantine, so I decided to go out and have some fun by recreating one of my favorite tv shows. I had a lot of fun making this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CJ_MH1a3i0&t=0s"> project </a>. I hope you enjoy watching it as much as I enjoyed making it.</p>

							<h2>Outside Resources</h2>
							<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc81WI54KgJoei06f_3mWgQ"> This show </a> is the inspiration for my video. Just a guy who got his start buy running up to New Yorkers and asking them pop culture questions. I love the simplicity of it, and the innovation it has put into the "talk show" circuit. While a man on the street segment is nothing new to the entertainment world, this style and tone certainly is.</p>
